This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for a Danish board advisory and presentation project focused on AI in the education sector. The goal is to establish expertise in board and leadership guidance about AI in educational institutions.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **documentation and content repository** for developing board seminar materials, presentations, and workshops. It currently contains three key documents in Danish:

- **Instruktion til projektet.txt**: Project goals and scope
- **Ramme for oplæg til bestyrelser.txt**: Framework for board presentations (structure, design, key decisions)
- **Rammer for visuals og præsentationer.txt**: Visual design guidelines and best practices for board presentations

## Key Content Principles

### Board Presentation Structure
1. Strategic agenda with decisions prioritized first
2. Professional presentation opening with vision/strategic goals
3. Early presentation of decision proposals with clear rationale
4. Visual elements (icons, timelines, graphics) for clarity
5. Clear documentation of decisions with responsibilities and deadlines
6. Appendix for detailed supporting materials

### Visual Design Guidelines
- **Leadership-driven narrative and storytelling**: Start with clear, bold goals
- **Executive summary slides**: Minimal details, scannable text, large fonts
- **Strategic visual hierarchy**: Guide attention with contrast and placement
- **Brand-aligned visuals**: Clean, simple, confident visual style
- **Clarity first - decisions upfront**: Place bottom-line/key decisions first
- **Action-oriented next steps**: End with powerful, concise recommendations
- **Smart data visualization**: Summarize insights, avoid data overload
- **Professional consistency**: Maintain visual identity throughout
- **Appendix for deep-dive**: Backup slides for detailed Q&A

## Language

All content is in **Danish**. Maintain Danish language when working with existing files or creating new content unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

## Future Development

This repository may expand to include:
- Presentation templates (PowerPoint/Google Slides)
- Workshop materials and exercises
- Case studies and examples
- Supporting research and references
- Marketing and outreach materials
